# FUDGE'S CODE MENU BUILD PACK THINGY

### THIS GUIDE IS VERY VERY BASIC FOR NOW AND PROBABLY DOESN'T EXPLAIN A BUNCHA STUFF VERY WELL BUT I THINK IT'LL STILL BE COOL FOR THE TIME BEING

This is a custom build of wombat's custom build of Project+ that adds a whole slew of training features at the press of three buttons.

When in a match, all you need to do is press L+R+DPadUp and a menu will appear in the top-left. 
You navigate this menu with the dpad. You press A to enter, and B to exit. When pressing the "unpause" button, you press L+DUp to go back to controlling the menu.
when over a value, you can adjust it by pressing left and right on the DPad. Hold Y while doing this to adjust the value by 10.

Here's a list of all the options for each player:
## COMBO TRAINER
  - Combo trainer is a menu that assists you in training against the different characters of the cast.
  - enabled: turns it on (go figure)
  - noclip: used when setting the position of the target, allows you to pass through walls and floors
  - damage: adjusts the character's damage
  - combo timer: displays how many frames left until they go back to their previous position
  - remaining hitstun: a bar that shows a visual of how much hitstun is left
  - combo adjust: offsets the number of frames until the character goes back to their previous position
  - shield: displays the shield remaining
  - shieldstun taken: displays the number of frames of shieldstun that was taken
  - shieldstun: a meter giving a visual of how long they have left until they can act
  - fix position: fixes the target in a position until they get hit/recieve hitstun. 
  - set position: unpauses the game and lets you set a position for the target with the control stick
  - randomize position: randomizes the position the target gets sent to each time
  - set on ground: forces the randomized position to be on the ground
  - randomize damage: sets the target's damage to a random value between 0 and 100

#### SUGGESTED SETTINGS:
  - enabled: on
  - noclip: off
  - damage: 0
  - combo adjust: 30
  - fix position: on
  - set on ground: off
  - randomize position: on
  - randomize damage: on

## TRAJECTORY LINE
  - displays a line that approximates the direction in which the target player will travel. 
  - enabled: turns it on
  - thickness: how thick the line is
  - segments: how many line segments there are (max 10)
  - segment length: how many frames ahead each segment should represent (max 20)

#### SUGGESTED SETTINGS:
  - enabled: on
  - default everything else

## AI TRAINING
  - unfinished lmao don't use this

## ACTIONABLE OVERLAY:
  - turns the character green when they're in an actionable state + a darker shade of green when in IASA frames

## ACTIONABLE SOUND:
  - plays a sound with the specified ID whenever the target is actionable

## INPUT DISPLAY:
  - displays an inputs of the target player at the top

also it has custom experimental AI for falcon and falco (smart DI and schmooves but doesn't attack)
along with old custom AI for mewtwo, pikachu, and marth (attacks and is still better than default AI but is old)
