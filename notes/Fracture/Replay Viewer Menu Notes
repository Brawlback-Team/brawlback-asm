    Decryption handled from 8003b0b4 to 8003b1a4
    Quits out if setup fails

    nteSection from 8003b1b8 to 8003b1ec
    if data is not in correct format, load will fail

    data should have data type at 0x15 (should be 2 for replays)


0: 2
4: heap
8: 80461690
C: replay* (placeholder, then copy of uncompressed replay)
10: replay size (placeholder, then size)

    Whole thing should be encrypted
